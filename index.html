            <p> Hello all! I'm Corey Gish. I love my family, I love the gospel, I love my covnants, I love my wonderful wife and I'm starting to love programming! Recently I've been enjoying TTRP's with a samll group that I am currently the DM of <strong>It's really rewarding to see my playres enjoying their experiance in my world, It makes me realize just how much care our heavenly father put into this world to make sure each one of us has ways to experiance joy on this world of his design.</strong> In the next few years I hope to land a job as a remote Software Developer then after I get some solid experiance and stability I'll hopefully begin designing and programming games in VR and/or becoming an AI Engineer then maybe one day I could start my own company and hire and teach my children and wife about the buisness. </p>

As one of the original thirteen colonies, Maryland boasts a rich colonial heritage, as is evident by landmarks like the historic city of Annapolis and the birthplace of the national anthem, Fort McHenry. Legend also tells of Mayland's very own cryptid a possible Loch-Ness like creature lovingly named Chessie after its home in the Chespeake bay. </p>
